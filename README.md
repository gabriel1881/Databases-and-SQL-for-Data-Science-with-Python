# Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python (IBM - Coursera)

This repository contains the **final project** for the _"Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python"_ course by IBM on Coursera.

## Course Overview

This course is part of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate** and focuses on introducing databases, specifically SQL, and how to use SQL to work with data in a data science context. The primary tools used include **Jupyter Notebooks** and **Python** for executing SQL queries.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- **Introduction to Databases**:  
  Understanding relational databases, tables, and relationships between them.
- **Basic SQL**:  
  Writing basic SQL queries including `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and filtering data.
- **SQL Joins**:  
  Using `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and other types of joins to combine data from multiple tables.
- **SQL Functions**:  
  Working with aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `AVG`, `SUM`, etc.) and using `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` to group and filter data.
- **Accessing Databases with Python**:  
  Using libraries like `sqlite3` to interact with SQL databases directly from Python scripts.
- **Advanced SQL Queries**:  
  Writing subqueries, using `UNION`, and performing more complex data manipulation.
- **Working with Real-World Datasets**:  
  Importing and querying datasets to gain insights and perform analysis.

## Final Project

The final project demonstrates the application of the concepts covered throughout the course. It involves querying a database using **SQL** to extract meaningful insights, manipulating the data as needed, and presenting the results.

In this project, you will find the following:
- SQL queries to analyze data and extract insights.
- Python code to manage database interactions.
- Data analysis and visualization components.
